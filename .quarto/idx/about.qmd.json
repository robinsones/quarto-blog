Previously, I worked at Warby Parker as a senior data scientist on a centralized team tackling some of the company's biggest projects, including redesigning their experimentation platform and training and deploying machine learning models; at DataCamp, where I built and ran their experimentation analytics system; and at Etsy, where I worked with their search team to design, implement, and analyze experiments.\n\nI'm an author of the book [Build a Career in Data Science](https://www.manning.com/books/build-your-career-in-data-science?a_aid=buildcareer&a_bid=76784b6a) with [Jacqueline Nolis](https://jnolis.com/), and the [accompanying podcast](podcast.bestbook.cool). You can get 40% off the book with the code buildbook40%. I regularly give talks on A/B testing, R programming, and data science career advice at conferences and meetups (see all talks [here](https://hookedondata.org/speaking/)). \n\nI hold a Master's degree in Management (specialization in Organizational Behavior) from INSEAD. I also earned my bachelor's degree from Rice University in Decision Sciences, an interdisciplinary major I designed that focused on understanding how people behave and make decisions.\n\nI love all animals and consider myself part of the [#rcatladies](https://twitter.com/hashtag/rcatladies) despite not owning a cat. I do have a dog, Yeti, a 30-pound ball of fluff who loves cuddles.\n\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["styles.css"],"output-file":"about.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.2.269","theme":"custom.scss","title":"About","image":"img/yeti_picture.jpg","about":{"template":"jolla","links":[{"icon":"twitter","text":"Twitter","href":"https://twitter.com/robinson_es"},{"icon":"linkedin","text":"LinkedIn","href":"https://linkedin.com/in/robinsones"},{"icon":"github","text":"Github","href":"https://github.com/robinsones"}]}},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
