I walked through an example analysis of [Kaggle's 2017 State of Data Science and Machine Learning Survey](https://www.kaggle.com/kaggle/kaggle-survey-2017) to show how I would use these functions in an exploratory analysis. \n\nThis post shares that analysis with some extra written commentary. If you'd like to watch the talks as well, both the [RStudio::conf](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/videos/the-lesser-known-stars-of-the-tidyverse/) and [New York R conference](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ax4LXQ5t38k) ones were recorded.\n\n## Reading in the data\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst, we'll try reading in our dataset with base R's `read.csv`.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmultiple_choice_responses_base <- read.csv(\"multipleChoiceResponses.csv\")\n```\n:::\n\n\nLet's say we wanted to know the numbers of NAs in each column. We can use `is.na` to change each entry in a column to TRUE or FALSE, depending on whether it's NA, and then sum the column (because `TRUE` evaluates as 1 and `FALSE` as 0) to get the total number of NAs. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# for one column\nsum(is.na(multiple_choice_responses_base$Country))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 0\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nTo do this for a group of columns, say the first five, we can use `summarise_at` function. `summarise_at` takes three arguments: the dataset, which we pipe in, the set of columns we want to apply a function to, and a function to apply to each of the columns. It returns a dataframe with the same column names and one row with the result of our function. In our case, that will be the number of NAs in each column.\n\nYou can select the columns by position, as we'll do here with `1:5`, or by name. Note that if you do it by name, you need to put them within `vars()` (e.g. `vars(GenderSelect:StudentStatus)` or `vars(GenderSelect, Age)`). \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# for five columns\nmultiple_choice_responses_base %>%\n  summarise_at(1:5, ~sum(is.na(.))) \n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n  GenderSelect Country Age EmploymentStatus StudentStatus\n1            0       0 331                0             0\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWow that's lucky! Four of them that don't have any NAs. But ... is this too good to be true? Let's look at the entries of one column.  \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmultiple_choice_responses_base %>%\n  count(StudentStatus) \n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n  StudentStatus     n\n1               15436\n2            No   299\n3           Yes   981\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nYep. We see here we have a lot of `\"\"` entries instead of NAs. We can correct this with `na_if` from `dplyr`, which takes as an argument what we want to turn into NAs. We can also use `%<>%`, which is a reassignment pipe. While this is nice to save some typing, it can make it confusing when reading a script, so use with caution. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmultiple_choice_responses_base %<>%\n  na_if(\"\")\n\n## is the same as: \n\nmultiple_choice_responses_base <- multiple_choice_responses_base %>%\n  na_if(\"\")\n```\n:::\n\n\nNow let's count the NAs again. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmultiple_choice_responses_base %>%\n  summarise_at(1:5, ~sum(is.na(.))) \n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n  GenderSelect Country Age EmploymentStatus StudentStatus\n1           95     121 331                0         15436\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nAnd it's fixed! \n\nHow could we have avoided this all in the first place? By using `readr::read_csv` instead of `read.csv`.\n\nIf you're not familiar with `::`, it's for explicitly setting what package you're getting the function on the right from. This is helpful in three ways:\n\n  1) There can be name conflicts, where two packages have functions with the same name. Using `::` ensures you're getting the function you want. \n  2) if you only want to use one function from a package, you can use `::` to skip the library call. As long as you've installed the package, you don't need to have loaded it to get the function. \n  3) For teaching purposes, it's nice to remind people where the function is coming from. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmultiple_choice_responses <- readr::read_csv(\"multipleChoiceResponses.csv\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\nWarning: One or more parsing issues, see `problems()` for details\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nIt's definitely faster, but it seems we have some errors. Let's inspect them. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nproblems(multiple_choice_responses)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n# A tibble: 65 × 5\n     row   col expected           actual           file \n   <int> <int> <chr>              <chr>            <chr>\n 1   297    84 1/0/T/F/TRUE/FALSE Rarely           \"\"   \n 2   673    84 1/0/T/F/TRUE/FALSE Most of the time \"\"   \n 3  1210   207 a number           -                \"\"   \n 4  1317    99 1/0/T/F/TRUE/FALSE Rarely           \"\"   \n 5  1595    99 1/0/T/F/TRUE/FALSE Often            \"\"   \n 6  2444    99 1/0/T/F/TRUE/FALSE Most of the time \"\"   \n 7  2467    99 1/0/T/F/TRUE/FALSE Most of the time \"\"   \n 8  2623    99 1/0/T/F/TRUE/FALSE Often            \"\"   \n 9  2631    99 1/0/T/F/TRUE/FALSE Sometimes        \"\"   \n10  2725    99 1/0/T/F/TRUE/FALSE Often            \"\"   \n# … with 55 more rows\n# ℹ Use `print(n = ...)` to see more rows\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWe see each row and column where a problem occurs. What's happening is that `read_csv` uses the first 1000 rows of a column to guess its type. But in some cases, it's guessing the column is an integer, because the first 1000 rows are whole numbers, when actually it should be double, as some entries have decimal points. We can fix this by changing the number of rows `read_csv` uses to guess the column type (with the `guess_max` argument) to the number of rows in the data set. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmultiple_choice_responses <- readr::read_csv(\"multipleChoiceResponses.csv\", \n                                             guess_max = nrow(multiple_choice_responses))\n```\n:::\n\n\nError-free!\n\n## Initial examination \n\nLet's see what we can glean from the column names themselves. I'll only look at the first 20 since there are so many. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ncolnames(multiple_choice_responses) %>%\n  head(20)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n [1] \"GenderSelect\"                      \"Country\"                          \n [3] \"Age\"                               \"EmploymentStatus\"                 \n [5] \"StudentStatus\"                     \"LearningDataScience\"              \n [7] \"CodeWriter\"                        \"CareerSwitcher\"                   \n [9] \"CurrentJobTitleSelect\"             \"TitleFit\"                         \n[11] \"CurrentEmployerType\"               \"MLToolNextYearSelect\"             \n[13] \"MLMethodNextYearSelect\"            \"LanguageRecommendationSelect\"     \n[15] \"PublicDatasetsSelect\"              \"LearningPlatformSelect\"           \n[17] \"LearningPlatformUsefulnessArxiv\"   \"LearningPlatformUsefulnessBlogs\"  \n[19] \"LearningPlatformUsefulnessCollege\" \"LearningPlatformUsefulnessCompany\"\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWe can see that there were categories of questions, like \"LearningPlatform,\" with each platform having its own column.\n\nNow let's take a look at our numeric columns with [skimr](https://github.com/ropensci/skimr). Skimr is a package from [rOpenSci](https://ropensci.org/) that allows you to quickly view summaries of your data. We  can use `select_if`  to select only columns where a certain condition, in this case whether it's a numeric column, is true.  \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmultiple_choice_responses %>%\n  select_if(is.numeric) %>%\n  skimr::skim()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\nTable: Data summary\n\n|                         |           |\n|:------------------------|:----------|\n|Name                     |Piped data |\n|Number of rows           |16716      |\n|Number of columns        |13         |\n|_______________________  |           |\n|Column type frequency:   |           |\n|numeric                  |13         |\n|________________________ |           |\n|Group variables          |None       |\n\n\n**Variable type: numeric**\n\n|skim_variable                 | n_missing| complete_rate|  mean|    sd| p0| p25| p50| p75| p100|hist  |\n|:-----------------------------|---------:|-------------:|-----:|-----:|--:|---:|---:|---:|----:|:-----|\n|Age                           |       331|          0.98| 32.37| 10.47|  0|  25|  30|  37|  100|▁▇▂▁▁ |\n|LearningCategorySelftTaught   |      3607|          0.78| 33.37| 25.79|  0|  15|  30|  50|  100|▇▅▃▂▁ |\n|LearningCategoryOnlineCourses |      3590|          0.79| 27.38| 26.86|  0|   5|  20|  40|  100|▇▃▂▁▁ |\n|LearningCategoryWork          |      3605|          0.78| 15.22| 19.00|  0|   0|  10|  25|  100|▇▂▁▁▁ |\n|LearningCategoryUniversity    |      3594|          0.78| 16.99| 23.68|  0|   0|   5|  30|  100|▇▂▁▁▁ |\n|LearningCategoryKaggle        |      3590|          0.79|  5.53| 11.07|  0|   0|   0|  10|  100|▇▁▁▁▁ |\n|LearningCategoryOther         |      3622|          0.78|  1.80|  9.36|  0|   0|   0|   0|  100|▇▁▁▁▁ |\n|TimeGatheringData             |      9186|          0.45| 36.14| 21.65|  0|  20|  35|  50|  100|▇▇▆▂▁ |\n|TimeModelBuilding             |      9188|          0.45| 21.27| 16.17|  0|  10|  20|  30|  100|▇▃▁▁▁ |\n|TimeProduction                |      9199|          0.45| 10.81| 12.26|  0|   0|  10|  15|  100|▇▁▁▁▁ |\n|TimeVisualizing               |      9187|          0.45| 13.87| 11.72|  0|   5|  10|  20|  100|▇▁▁▁▁ |\n|TimeFindingInsights           |      9193|          0.45| 13.09| 12.97|  0|   5|  10|  20|  303|▇▁▁▁▁ |\n|TimeOtherSelect               |      9203|          0.45|  2.40| 12.16|  0|   0|   0|   0|  100|▇▁▁▁▁ |\n:::\n:::\n\n\nI love the histograms. We can quickly see from them that people self teach a lot and spend a good amount of time building models and gathering data, compared to visualizing data or working in production.   \n\nLet's see how many distinct answers we have for each question. We can use `n_distinct()`, a shorter and faster version of `length(unique())`. We'll use `summarise_all`, which is the same as `summarise_at` except that you don't select a group of columns and so it applies to every one in the dataset.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmultiple_choice_responses %>%\n  summarise_all(n_distinct) %>%\n  select(1:10)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n# A tibble: 1 × 10\n  Gender…¹ Country   Age Emplo…² Stude…³ Learn…⁴ CodeW…⁵ Caree…⁶ Curre…⁷ Title…⁸\n     <int>   <int> <int>   <int>   <int>   <int>   <int>   <int>   <int>   <int>\n1        5      53    85       7       3       4       3       3      17       4\n# … with abbreviated variable names ¹​GenderSelect, ²​EmploymentStatus,\n#   ³​StudentStatus, ⁴​LearningDataScience, ⁵​CodeWriter, ⁶​CareerSwitcher,\n#   ⁷​CurrentJobTitleSelect, ⁸​TitleFit\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThis data would be more helpful if it was tidy and had two columns, `question` and `num_distinct_answers`. We can use `tidyr::gather` to change our data from \"wide\" to \"long\" format and then `arrange` it so we can see the columns with the most distinct answers first. If you've used (or are still using!) reshape2, check out tidyr; reshape2 is retired and is only updated with changes necessary for it to remain on CRAN. While not exactly equivalent, `tidyr::spread` replaces `reshape2::dcast`, `tidyr::separate` `reshape2::colsplit`, and `tidyr::gather` `reshape2::melt`. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmultiple_choice_responses %>%\n  summarise_all(n_distinct) %>%\n  tidyr::gather(question, num_distinct_answers) %>%\n  arrange(desc(num_distinct_answers))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n# A tibble: 228 × 2\n   question               num_distinct_answers\n   <chr>                                 <int>\n 1 WorkMethodsSelect                      6191\n 2 LearningPlatformSelect                 5363\n 3 WorkToolsSelect                        5249\n 4 WorkChallengesSelect                   4288\n 5 WorkDatasetsChallenge                  2221\n 6 PastJobTitlesSelect                    1856\n 7 MLTechniquesSelect                     1802\n 8 WorkDatasets                           1723\n 9 WorkAlgorithmsSelect                   1421\n10 MLSkillsSelect                         1038\n# … with 218 more rows\n# ℹ Use `print(n = ...)` to see more rows\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nLet's take a look at the question with the most distinct answers, WorkMethodsSelect. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmultiple_choice_responses %>%\n  count(WorkMethodsSelect, sort = TRUE)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n# A tibble: 6,191 × 2\n   WorkMethodsSelect                           n\n   <chr>                                   <int>\n 1 <NA>                                     8943\n 2 Data Visualization                        144\n 3 Other                                     144\n 4 Logistic Regression                        66\n 5 Time Series Analysis                       49\n 6 Neural Networks                            45\n 7 A/B Testing                                42\n 8 Data Visualization,Time Series Analysis    37\n 9 Text Analytics                             36\n10 Decision Trees                             29\n# … with 6,181 more rows\n# ℹ Use `print(n = ...)` to see more rows\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWe can see this is a multiple select question, where if a person selected multiple answers they're listed as one entry, separated by commas.

This was one of those categories where there were multiple questions asked, all having names starting with `WorkChallengeFrequency` and ending with the challenge (e.g \"DirtyData\"). \n\nWe can find the relevant columns by using the dplyr `select` helper `contains`. We then use `gather` to tidy the data for analysis, filter for only the non-NAs, and remove the `WorkChallengeFrequency` from each question using `stringr::str_remove`. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nWorkChallenges <- multiple_choice_responses %>%\n  select(contains(\"WorkChallengeFrequency\")) %>%\n  gather(question, response) %>%\n  filter(!is.na(response)) %>%\n  mutate(question = stringr::str_remove(question, \"WorkChallengeFrequency\")) \n\nWorkChallenges\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n# A tibble: 31,486 × 2\n   question response        \n   <chr>    <chr>           \n 1 Politics Rarely          \n 2 Politics Often           \n 3 Politics Often           \n 4 Politics Often           \n 5 Politics Rarely          \n 6 Politics Most of the time\n 7 Politics Often           \n 8 Politics Often           \n 9 Politics Rarely          \n10 Politics Most of the time\n# … with 31,476 more rows\n# ℹ Use `print(n = ...)` to see more rows\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nLet's make a facet bar plot, one for each question with the frequency of responses.To make the x-axis tick labels readable, we'll change them to be vertical instead of horizontal. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(WorkChallenges, aes(x = response)) + \n  geom_bar() + \n  facet_wrap(~question) + \n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/WorkChallenges_graph1-1.png){width=864}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThis graph has two main problems. First, there are too many histograms for it to be really useful. But second, the order of the x-axis is wrong. We want it to go from least often to most, but instead `rarely` is in the middle. We can manually reorder the level of this variable using `forcats::fct_relevel`. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nWorkChallenges %>%\n  mutate(response = fct_relevel(response, \"Rarely\", \"Sometimes\", \n                                \"Often\", \"Most of the time\")) %>%\n  ggplot(aes(x = response)) + \n  geom_bar() + \n  facet_wrap(~question) + \n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/WorkChallenges_graph2-1.png){width=864}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nNow we've got the x-axis in the order we want it. Let's try dichotomizing the variable by grouping \"most of the time\" and \"often\" together as the person considering something a challenge. We can use `if_else` and `%in%`. `%in%` is equivalent to `response == \"Most of the time\" | response == \"Often\"` and can save you a lot of typing if you have a bunch of variables to match. \n\nGrouping by the question, we can use `summarise` to reduce the dataset to one row per question, adding the variable `perc_problem` for the percentage of responses that thought something was a challenge often or most of the time. This way, we can make one graph with data for all the questions and easily compare them. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nperc_problem_work_challenge <- WorkChallenges %>%\n  mutate(response = if_else(response %in% c(\"Most of the time\", \"Often\"), 1, 0)) %>%\n  group_by(question) %>%\n  summarise(perc_problem = mean(response)) \n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(perc_problem_work_challenge, aes(x = question, y = perc_problem)) + \n  geom_point() +\n  coord_flip()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/perc_problem_work_challenge_graph-1.png){width=768}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThis is better, but it's hard to read because the points are scattered all over the place. Although you can spot the highest one, you then have to track it back to the correct variable. And it's also hard to tell the order of the ones in the middle. \n\nWe can use `forcats:fct_reorder` to change the x-axis to be ordered by another variable, in this case the y-axis. While we're at it, we can use `scale_y_continuous` and`scales::percent` to update our axis to display in percent and `labs` to change our axis labels. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(perc_problem_work_challenge, \n       aes(x = perc_problem, \n           y = fct_reorder(question, perc_problem))) + \n  geom_point() +\n  scale_x_continuous(labels = scales::percent) + \n  labs(y = \"Work Challenge\", \n       x = \"Percentage of people encountering challenge frequently\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/perc_problem_work_challenge_graph2-1.png){width=768}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nMuch better! You can now easily tell which work challenges are encountered most frequently. \n\n### Conclusion\n\nI'm a big advocate of using and teaching the tidyverse for data analysis and visualization in R (it runs [in the family](http://varianceexplained.org/r/teach-tidyverse/)). In addition to doing these talks, I've released a DataCamp course on [Categorical Data in the Tidyverse](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/categorical-data-in-the-tidyverse). I walk through some of the functions in this course and more from forcats. It's part of the new [Tidyverse Fundamentals skill track](https://www.datacamp.com/tracks/tidyverse-fundamentals), which is suitable for people are new to R or those looking to switch to the tidyverse. Check it out and let us know what you think. \n\nSome other good resources for learning the tidyverse are Hadley Wickham and Garrett Grolemund's free [R for Data Science book](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/) and [RStudio's cheat sheets](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/). If you have questions, I recommend using the [tidyverse section of RStudio community](https://community.rstudio.com/c/tidyverse) and/or the #rstats hashtag on Twitter. If you do, make sure you include a reproducible example (see best practices [here](https://reprex.tidyverse.org/articles/reprex-dos-and-donts.html)) with the [reprex package](https://reprex.tidyverse.org/articles/articles/magic-reprex.html)!\n\n",
