I'm currently a senior data scientist at Game Data Pros, developing tools and providing consulting for video game companies to optimize revenue Previously, I worked at Warby Parker as a senior data scientist on a centralized team tackling some of the company's biggest projects, including redesigning their experimentation platform and training and deploying machine learning models; at DataCamp, where I built and ran their experimentation analytics system; and at Etsy, where I worked with their search team to design, implement, and analyze experiments.

I'm an author of the book [Build a Career in Data Science](https://www.manning.com/books/build-your-career-in-data-science?a_aid=buildcareer&a_bid=76784b6a) with [Jacqueline Nolis](https://jnolis.com/), and the [accompanying podcast](podcast.bestbook.cool). You can get 40% off the book with the code buildbook40%. I've given talks around the country and internationally on A/B testing, R programming, and data science career advice at conferences and meetups (see all talks [here](https://hookedondata.org/speaking/)). 

I hold a Master's degree in Management (specialization in Organizational Behavior) from INSEAD. I also earned my bachelor's degree from Rice University in Decision Sciences, an interdisciplinary major I designed that focused on understanding how people behave and make decisions.

I love all animals and consider myself part of the [#rcatladies](https://twitter.com/hashtag/rcatladies) despite not owning a cat. I do have a dog, Yeti, a 30-pound ball of fluff who loves cuddles.
